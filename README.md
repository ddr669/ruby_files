# Ruby 💎

</div>


Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.  


He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.  


> Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body1.
